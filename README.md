This project has taken around 7 months *(mostly due to procrastination and my irl job)* to complete. I have never made a project like this before, and I am honestly very happy with the outcome. Therefore, I will likely end up designing a second and possibly further iterations of this project that encompass the rest of the Bullet Kin family in the coming future.

#### This is a 2 part project:
1. **Part one** consists of the `physical hardware` which is a bullet kin shell with electronics inside(bullegachi).
|
2. **Part two** consists of the `software` which is a tamagotchi inspired desktop companion that is directly based off and interacts with the bullegachi made in part one.

Due to the nature of this repository I will be housing `part two` on this page as it seems the most fitting.

`part one` will be on [my site]() where I go into detail on the design process and my method of assembly.

## The Software.

The Bullegachi desktop application is written in (`javascript`, `html` and `css`) and is utilizing [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) for the actual application functionality(a window, [tray menu](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/api/tray), etc).
